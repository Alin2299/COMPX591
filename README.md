### COMPX591 Project: Managing the Uptake of Electric Vehicles in New Zealand

#### Undertaken by: Andrew Lin
#### Supervised by: Professor Mark Apperley

#### Summary:
This research project involved the development of an interactive computer model for exploring how various scenarios, including electric vehicle (EV) uptake, affect 
electricity demand and supply in  New Zealand. The tool allows users to simulate different charging behaviours, EV adoption rates, infrastructure 
expansion scenarios, and various other parameters, and then observe how these factors influence 
national and regional electricity load profiles over time.  

The research and final developed tool (i.e. Prototype 2) draws on publicly available datasets from sources such as the Electricity Authority and the New Zealand Transport Agency. It is designed as an exploratory prototype, rather than a purely predictive or statistical model, and the overall goal is to help policymakers, researchers, and the public 
better understand the scale and timing of changes that are likely to occur, as New Zealand eventually transitions to a low-emissions economy, energy, and electrical sector.  
Additionally, it also serves to translate theoretical research into a practical and accessible format, and lay the groundwork for future relevant work.

The main files for this project are split into 3 Python code files:
- helper.py - this file contains various helper functions for helping run the model and ensure it is sufficiently performant
- prototype1.py - this file implements Prototype 1 of the model, which is focused on testing and verifying the use of the Streamlit library, as well as basic data handling
- prototype2.py - this file implements Prototype 2, which incorporates all functionality and data as mentioned above

This research project was developed for the COMPX591 - Dissertation paper at the University of Waikato, as part of a BSc with Honours in Computer Science in 2025.
